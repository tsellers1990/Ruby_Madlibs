    {Name_1} and {Name_2}
    Went up the hill
    To fetch a pail of {Fluid_1}
    {Name_1} {Action_1}
    And broke his {Object_1},
    And {Name_2} came tumbling after.

    Up {Name_1} got
    And {Place_1} did trot,
    As fast as he could caper;
    Went to bed
    To mend his head
    With {Fluid_2} and {Object_2}.

    {Name_2} came in
    And she did grin
    To see his paper plaster;
    Mother, vexâ€™d,
    Did whip her next
    For causing {Name_1}'s disaster")
